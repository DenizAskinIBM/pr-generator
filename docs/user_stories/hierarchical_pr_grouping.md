Okay, here is the user story and a detailed implementation approach for introducing a hierarchical agent structure for batching in your CrewAI system.

## User Story

**As a** developer using the AI PR Grouping system,
**I want** the system to employ a hierarchical agent structure (Supervisor + Worker Crew) to process repositories with a large number of changed files (e.g., > 100-200 files potentially exceeding context limits),
**By** having a Supervisor Agent perform initial analysis, divide the files into manageable batches, delegate the detailed grouping/validation/refinement of each batch to a Worker Crew, and then intelligently merge the results,
**So that** the system reliably handles large-scale changes without hitting LLM context window limits and produces a coherent, well-structured set of PR suggestions covering all changes in the repository.
