# PR Recommendation System - User Story Analysis

## INVEST Criteria Review

The INVEST criteria helps evaluate if user stories are well-formed:
- **Independent**: Can be developed separately from other stories
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Provides value to users
- **Estimable**: Team can estimate the effort required
- **Small**: Can be completed in a reasonable timeframe
- **Testable**: Success can be verified

## MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW method prioritizes requirements as Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, or Won't Have.

### Must Have (MVP)

1. **Developer: Analyze uncommitted files** - Foundation of the system
2. **Developer: Receive PR grouping recommendations** - Core value proposition
3. **Developer: Verify all files are included** - Essential for completeness
4. **Tech Lead: Balanced file groups** - Critical for usability
5. **Run locally for security** - Essential for adoption in most companies
6. **Complete within reasonable time** - Necessary for user adoption

### Should Have (High Value)

1. **Developer: See generated PR titles and descriptions** - High productivity value
2. **Tech Lead: See rationale for each PR** - Important for reviewing recommendations
3. **Developer: Alternative grouping options** - Important flexibility
4. **User: Override recommendations** - Important for practicality
5. **Clear explanations for groupings** - Builds trust in the system
6. **Team: Configure max PR sizes** - Important for team workflow

### Could Have (Valuable but not essential)

1. **Tech Lead: Understand file relationships** - Helpful but not crucial
2. **PM: Feature-oriented PR groupings** - Valuable but more complex
3. **Developer: Identify multi-PR files** - Nice to have
4. **Team: Prioritize change types** - Adds value but not critical
5. **Team: Integrate with PR templates** - Useful integration
6. **Maintainer: See PR dependencies** - Helpful for complex changes
7. **User: Provide codebase architecture context** - Would improve recommendations
8. **Save/compare grouping strategies** - Useful but not essential

### Won't Have (Future considerations)

1. **PM: Map code changes to requirements** - Too dependent on external systems
2. **Developer: Guidance on breaking up files** - Complex, could be future feature
3. **Maintainer: Identify potential merge conflicts** - Complex, better for v2
4. **Maintainer: Optimal PR sequence** - Advanced feature for future
5. **User: Language-specific patterns** - Too broad, better to introduce gradually
6. **PM: Meaningful PR titles related to features** - Requires external context

## Summary Analysis

The PR Recommendation System's core value lies in automatically analyzing uncommitted changes and suggesting logical PR groupings. This addresses the primary pain point for developers dealing with large sets of changes.

The "Must Have" stories form a coherent MVP that provides immediate value to developers and technical leads. The "Should Have" items significantly enhance the user experience and should be considered for early incremental releases after the MVP.

Stories with lower INVEST scores, particularly those requiring integration with external systems or complex analysis, are appropriately categorized as "Could Have" or "Won't Have" for future consideration.
