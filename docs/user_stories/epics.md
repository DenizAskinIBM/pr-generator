# PR Recommendation System - Epics

Epics organize related user stories into larger, meaningful groups that represent major features or capabilities of the system.

## Epic 1: Git Repository Analysis

**Description**: Analyze uncommitted Git changes to extract file information, understand technical content, and identify relationships between files.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to automatically analyze all my uncommitted files so that I can understand their relationships without manually reviewing each one
- As a technical lead, I want to understand the relationships between files in each group so that I can evaluate if the grouping makes sense
- As a user, I want the analysis to complete within 2 minutes even for large repositories so that I don't waste time waiting
- As a user, I want to run the tool locally without sending my code to external services so that proprietary code remains secure

**Success Criteria**:
- System can analyze a repository with 100+ uncommitted files
- Analysis completes within 2 minutes for repositories up to 10,000 files
- File content, relationships, and metadata are accurately extracted
- Analysis runs completely locally without external API dependencies (unless explicitly configured)

## Epic 2: Intelligent PR Grouping

**Description**: Group related files into logical pull request candidates based on directory structure, technical relationships, and change patterns.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to receive recommendations for logical PR groupings so that I can create focused, reviewable pull requests
- As a technical lead, I want to see logical groupings of related changes so that I can review code more efficiently
- As a technical lead, I want file groups to be balanced in size so that no single PR is too large or too small for efficient review
- As a developer, I want to see alternative grouping options for the same files so that I can choose the most appropriate organization
- As a developer, I want to understand when a file might belong in multiple PRs so that I can plan my commits appropriately

**Success Criteria**:
- Files are grouped into logical units that represent cohesive changes
- No single PR is excessively large (configurable threshold)
- All changed files are included in at least one PR recommendation
- System can provide alternative grouping strategies when appropriate
- System identifies files that could belong to multiple logical groups

## Epic 3: Content Generation

**Description**: Generate meaningful PR titles, descriptions, and supporting content to save developer time and improve communication.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to see meaningful PR titles and descriptions generated for each group so that I don't have to write them from scratch
- As a technical lead, I want to see a rationale for each suggested PR so that I can understand the reasoning behind the grouping
- As a user, I want clear explanations for why files were grouped together so that I trust the recommendations

**Success Criteria**:
- Generated PR titles clearly describe the purpose of changes
- PR descriptions include contextual information about the changes
- Each PR includes a clear rationale explaining why files were grouped together
- Content follows best practices for PR descriptions

## Epic 4: Configuration & Customization

**Description**: Provide ways to customize the system to fit team workflows, project requirements, and developer preferences.

**User Stories**:
- As a development team, I want to configure maximum PR sizes so that our team policies are followed
- As a development team, I want to prioritize certain types of changes so that critical changes are isolated
- As a development team, I want to integrate with our existing PR templates so that generated descriptions follow team standards
- As a user, I want to provide additional context about the codebase's architecture so that recommendations are better informed
- As a user, I want to override or adjust recommendations based on my domain knowledge so that the final PRs reflect project-specific needs

**Success Criteria**:
- System provides configuration options for PR size limits
- Users can prioritize certain change types
- PR templates can be customized or integrated with existing templates
- System accepts additional context that improves recommendations
- Users can override or adjust automatically generated recommendations

## Epic 5: Validation & Quality Assurance

**Description**: Ensure the completeness, quality, and balance of PR recommendations.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want to verify that all changed files are included in at least one PR recommendation so that nothing is accidentally omitted
- As a user, I want to be able to save and compare different grouping strategies so that I can evaluate alternatives

**Success Criteria**:
- System validates that all changed files are included in recommendations
- System warns about any files that might be accidentally omitted
- Different grouping strategies can be saved and compared
- Quality metrics are provided to evaluate recommendation quality

## Epic 6: Advanced PR Management (Future)

**Description**: Provide advanced features for managing complex sets of changes and optimal PR workflows.

**User Stories**:
- As a repository maintainer, I want to see dependency relationships between suggested PRs so that I can plan the merge order
- As a repository maintainer, I want to identify potential merge conflicts between suggested PRs so that I can mitigate them early
- As a repository maintainer, I want to receive suggestions for the optimal sequence of PRs to be reviewed and merged so that the process is smoother
- As a product manager, I want to see feature-oriented PR groupings so that I can track implementation progress
- As a product manager, I want to understand how code changes map to product requirements so that I can communicate progress to stakeholders

**Success Criteria**:
- System identifies dependencies between PR recommendations
- System can detect potential merge conflicts
- System can suggest optimal PR review/merge sequences
- When feature context is available, PRs can be organized by feature
- When requirement data is available, code changes can be mapped to requirements
