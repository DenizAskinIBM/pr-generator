# PR Recommendation System - User Stories

## Core User Stories

### As a developer with a large set of uncommitted changes
1. I want to automatically analyze all my uncommitted files so that I can understand their relationships without manually reviewing each one
2. I want to receive recommendations for logical PR groupings so that I can create focused, reviewable pull requests
3. I want to see meaningful PR titles and descriptions generated for each group so that I don't have to write them from scratch
4. I want to verify that all changed files are included in at least one PR recommendation so that nothing is accidentally omitted

### As a technical lead reviewing many changes
1. I want to see logical groupings of related changes so that I can review code more efficiently
2. I want to understand the relationships between files in each group so that I can evaluate if the grouping makes sense
3. I want to see a rationale for each suggested PR so that I can understand the reasoning behind the grouping
4. I want file groups to be balanced in size so that no single PR is too large or too small for efficient review

### As a product manager tracking feature progress
1. I want to see feature-oriented PR groupings so that I can track implementation progress
2. I want meaningful PR titles that relate to product features so that I can understand what's being worked on
3. I want to understand how code changes map to product requirements so that I can communicate progress to stakeholders

## Advanced User Stories

### As a developer working with cross-cutting changes
1. I want to see alternative grouping options for the same files so that I can choose the most appropriate organization
2. I want to understand when a file might belong in multiple PRs so that I can plan my commits appropriately
3. I want to get guidance on breaking up large files with unrelated changes so that my PRs are more focused

### As a development team needing custom PR policies
1. I want to configure maximum PR sizes so that our team policies are followed
2. I want to prioritize certain types of changes (security fixes, bug fixes, features) so that critical changes are isolated
3. I want to integrate with our existing PR templates so that generated descriptions follow team standards

### As a repository maintainer managing complex changes
1. I want to see dependency relationships between suggested PRs so that I can plan the merge order
2. I want to identify potential merge conflicts between suggested PRs so that I can mitigate them early
3. I want to receive suggestions for the optimal sequence of PRs to be reviewed and merged so that the process is smoother

### As a user with specialized technical contexts
1. I want the system to recognize language-specific or framework-specific patterns so that PRs respect technical boundaries
2. I want to provide additional context about the codebase's architecture so that recommendations are better informed
3. I want to override or adjust recommendations based on my domain knowledge so that the final PRs reflect project-specific needs

## Non-functional User Stories

1. I want the analysis to complete within 2 minutes even for large repositories so that I don't waste time waiting
2. I want to run the tool locally without sending my code to external services so that proprietary code remains secure
3. I want clear explanations for why files were grouped together so that I trust the recommendations
4. I want to be able to save and compare different grouping strategies so that I can evaluate alternatives
