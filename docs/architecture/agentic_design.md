# PR Recommendation System Architecture

## Component Structure

| Component | Type | Objective | Return Type | Tools Used | Reasoning |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Repository Analyzer** | Non-Agent Tool | Analyze the git repository to extract metadata and changes | `RepositoryAnalysis` | Git operations code | This is a non-LLM component that performs deterministic operations better handled by your existing code. It analyzes raw repository data efficiently without requiring LLM capabilities. |
| **PR Strategist** | Agent | Develop optimal strategies for grouping changes into logical PRs | N/A | Multiple tools | This requires creative thinking, pattern recognition, and decision-making that benefits from LLM reasoning, making it a perfect fit for an agent. |
| **PR Validator** | Agent | Validate and refine PR suggestions for completeness and quality | N/A | Validation tools | This requires judgment about PR quality and coherence, benefiting from LLM reasoning to identify issues that might not be obvious from mechanical checks. |
| **Repository Assessment** | Task | Evaluate repository structure and complexity to choose appropriate strategies | `RepoAssessmentResult` | RepoAnalyzer | This is a task because it's a discrete step in the workflow that produces a specific output the PR Strategist needs. |
| **PR Strategy Development** | Task | Create logical groups of files for PRs using appropriate strategies | `PRGroupingStrategy` | StrategySelector, FileGrouper | This is the core task of the PR Strategist agent that requires creative thinking to identify logical groupings. |
| **PR Validation** | Task | Verify PR groups for completeness, balance, and coherence | `PRValidationResult` | GroupValidator | This task provides quality control for the PR groups, ensuring they meet best practices. |
| **RepoAnalyzer** | Tool | Process git repository to extract metadata about changes | `RepositoryAnalysis` | N/A | Wrapper around your existing GitOperations that provides context for the strategist. |
| **StrategySelector** | Tool | Select appropriate grouping strategies based on repository characteristics | `StrategySelectionResult` | N/A | This tool helps the agent reason about which strategies to apply based on repository structure. |
| **DirectoryAnalyzer** | Tool | Analyze directory structure to identify organizational patterns | `DirectoryAnalysisResult` | N/A | Specialized tool for understanding hierarchical organization of the repository. |
| **PatternAnalyzer** | Tool | Identify patterns in file changes to detect related modifications | `PatternAnalysisResult` | N/A | Helps detect non-obvious relationships between changed files. |
| **FileGrouper** | Tool | Group files into logical PR suggestions | `FileGroupingResult` | N/A | Implements the actual grouping logic based on the selected strategy. |
| **GroupValidator** | Tool | Validate PR groups against best practices | `GroupValidationResult` | N/A | Ensures PR groups meet quality standards and best practices. |
| **GroupRefiner** | Tool | Refine and balance PR groups for optimal review experience | `PRGroupCollection` | N/A | Optimizes PR groups after initial creation to ensure balanced, reviewable PRs. |

## Workflow

1. Initial repository analysis is done using the non-agent Repository Analyzer tool
2. The PR Strategist agent:
   - First executes the Repository Assessment task to understand the repository
   - Then executes the PR Strategy Development task to create logical PR groups
3. The PR Validator agent then executes the PR Validation task to ensure quality
4. The final output is a validated PRGroupCollection that can be presented to the user

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Non-LLM operations (repository analysis) are handled by deterministic code
   - LLM operations (strategy, validation) are handled by agents
   - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility

2. **Strong Typing**
   - All inputs and outputs have clear Pydantic 2.0 types
   - Tasks specify their output_pydantic to ensure type safety
   - Type consistency is maintained throughout the entire workflow

3. **Modularity**
   - Components are designed for independent development and testing
   - Implementation details are encapsulated within each component
   - Interface-based design allows for component substitution

4. **Reuse of Existing Code**
   - Solution leverages existing GitOperations and models
   - Tools act as thin wrappers around core functionality
   - No duplication of already implemented capabilities

### Performance Considerations

1. **Context Window Management**
   - Progressive summarization techniques for large repositories
   - Hierarchical analysis to efficiently use context budget
   - Selective examination of representative files

2. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Caching of expensive operations (repository analysis)
   - Batch processing for large repositories
   - Intelligent chunking of repository changes

3. **Scalability**
   - Design accommodates repositories of various sizes
   - Graceful degradation for very large repositories
   - Parallel processing where appropriate

### Production Readiness

1. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling throughout
   - Graceful fallbacks when operations fail
   - Clear error messages with actionable information

2. **Observability**
   - Detailed logging at appropriate levels
   - Performance metrics for optimization
   - Tracing for complex workflows

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Snapshot testing for comparing output quality

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable based configuration
   - Sensible defaults with override capabilities
   - Separation of configuration from code

### Extensibility

1. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Pluggable grouping strategies to support different organizational approaches
   - Strategy selection based on repository characteristics
   - Easy addition of new strategies without changing core code

2. **Provider Abstraction**
   - Support for multiple LLM providers
   - Abstract provider interface
   - Configurable model parameters

3. **Tool Expansion**
   - Designed for easy addition of new tools
   - Clear tool interface for consistency
   - Tool registration mechanism
